Thermal engineering is a branch of mechanical engineering that studies heat energy and its conversion into other forms of energy.

It focuses on heat transfer, thermodynamics, and energy systems like engines, turbines, and refrigeration units.

Engineers design and optimize systems to efficiently use thermal energy while minimizing losses.

Applications include power plants, automotive engines, aerospace systems, and industrial processes.

The field is vital for energy efficiency, sustainability, and advancing modern technology.

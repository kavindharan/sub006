1.  A river begins in silence, beneath the dawn’s first breath,  
2.  It whispers through the valleys, untouched by grief or death.  
3.  The stones beneath its current remember ancient days,  
4.  When forests sang in chorus and skies were set ablaze.  

5.  The river carries secrets, of kingdoms lost to sand,  
6.  Of voices never spoken, of dreams that slipped from hand.  
7.  It bends around the mountains, it carves the earth with care,  
8.  A patient sculptor working, unseen yet always there.  

9.  Along its banks the children once chased the fireflies,  
10. Their laughter rose like lanterns, ascending to the skies.  
11. The elders told their stories, of battles, love, and rain,  
12. The river held their echoes, their joy, their loss, their pain.  

13. The moon would paint its silver across the flowing tide,  
14. And lovers traced their futures where shadows used to hide.  
15. The stars became companions, reflected in its face,  
16. A thousand constellations adrift in liquid space.  

17. Seasons came like dancers, each clothed in shifting hue,  
18. Spring in robes of emerald, summer in skies of blue.  
19. Autumn wore its amber, with leaves that kissed the stream,  
20. Winter draped in silence, a frost upon the dream.  

21. The river never faltered, though storms would rage and roar,  
22. It carried broken branches to some forgotten shore.  
23. It taught the world resilience, it taught the world to bend,  
24. That endings are beginnings, that loss is not the end.  

25. A poet sat beside it, with ink and fragile hands,  
26. He wrote of fleeting beauty, of time’s unyielding sands.  
27. His verses joined the water, dissolved into its song,  
28. And still the river murmurs, though centuries are long.  

29. A soldier once returned there, his armor scarred and torn,  
30. He knelt beside the current, his eyes both tired and worn.  
31. The river washed his sorrow, it cooled his burning mind,  
32. It whispered: “Peace is waiting, if only you are kind.”  

33. A mother held her infant, and dipped his feet within,  
34. She prayed the flowing water would cleanse the world of sin.  
35. The child laughed at the ripples, his future yet unknown,  
36. The river marked his presence, a seed already sown.  

37. The river saw the cities rise tall against the sky,  
38. It watched the smoke and thunder, it heard the engines cry.  
39. Yet still it kept on moving, unbroken, calm, and free,  
40. A witness to ambition, to what will come to be.  

41. The river knows the silence when all the lights are gone,  
42. It knows the hush of twilight, the breaking of the dawn.  
43. It knows the hand of mercy, the cruelty of war,  
44. It knows the fragile balance that humankind ignores.  

45. And when the stars are fading, when suns have burned away,  
46. The river will keep flowing, though night outlasts the day.  
47. For water is eternal, it shifts, it falls, it climbs,  
48. A mirror of existence, the endless river of time.  

49. So listen when it murmurs, its voice is soft yet clear,  
50. It speaks of all beginnings, it speaks of all we fear.  
51. It tells us we are fleeting, like shadows on the sand,  
52. Yet part of something greater, a truth we understand.  

53. The river is a teacher, its lessons vast and deep,  
54. It shows us how to wander, it shows us how to keep.  
55. It shows us how to loosen, to let the current guide,  
56. To trust the unseen future, to walk with humble stride.  

57. A child will grow to elder, an elder fade to dust,  
58. The river holds their memory, their laughter, love, and trust.  
59. It binds the generations, it ties the years as one,  
60. A thread that weaves forever, beneath the moon and sun.  

61. The river sings of patience, of journeys never done,  
62. Of battles fought in silence, of victories never won.  
63. It sings of fleeting moments, of beauty hard to hold,  
64. Of stories left unspoken, of legends yet untold.  

65. And when you stand beside it, with heart both
